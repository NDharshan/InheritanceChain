# InheritanceChain

This project attempts to create a system which would bring in an order to the process of transfer of CryptoCurrency to the surviving benificiaries of the deceased. The system of will and testament is non-existant in the crypto-currency world and given the anonymity and decentralized nature of the organization the system of asset-transfer is great concern. This was built during the FantomCode at RVITM May-2023.


# The problem this Application solves
* Post the demise of a person, the transfer of the assets of the person are governed by the laws vested in the interpretation of one's will. The share of the financial and immovable assets received by each beneficiary too lies in therein.
* During the decipher of the transfer one's crypto assets, when there is no centralized institution or body codifing the regulation here, How do we identify and regulate transfer ?


# Technology Stack
## Web Application
* Flask (Python)
* React
## Blockchain
* Ethereum
* Ganache
* Web3
* Solidity


# Getting started
Install the pre-requisite modules namely Flask, Web3 and other modules as applicable
Running the Detection Code independently
## Asset transfer
`python main.py`

# File Structure
## The runnable file, hosting the Application
`contract.py`
## The contract- details and benificiaries
`contract.json`

# Problems with the traditional system
* Lack of due execution i.e. procedural inadequacy 
* Lack of testamentary intention and capacity
* Undue influence
* Fraud or forgery
* Revocation: Claims by family

# Solution 



# Working and Features
* **Time-lock** One can lock the assets for a certain period of time following which the resources are transferred. While still there he may modigy the running time in the contract

* **Key-lock** A two key system is used in the transfer of assets. The first key is common among the benificiarires while alive; This prevent those apart from this list to access it. The second key is in trusted source or contract determines the proportion of inheritance to be recieved

* **Key Features** A novel solution considering crypto- currencies
Balanced principle and concept of working of Will interpresentation



# Snapshots of the Working Web Application

# Challenges we ran into and Acknowledgements
* We faced issues in the interface of blockchain and the python application.


# Further Enhancements
*	Methods to validate the occurance of the event of Death.
*	Secure third-party which preserves the validity of keys.
